# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 4
## Task statement:
### Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to make initial experiments with REST APIs and the Spark/Java framework for implementing microservices. In this assignment, you will be using the following software technologies:
- The Spark/Java framework: http://sparkjava.com
- The Postman tool: https://www.postman.com
- Swagger: https://swagger.io

### Experiment 1: Spark/Java Framework project and Postman

Clone the Spark/Java red-green-counter example from the lectures:

https://github.com/selabhvl/dat250-sparkjava-counter

and import it into your IDE. Use a web browser to run a GET request targeting `http://localhost:8080/counters` to check that the service is deployed and operational.

Now use the Postman tool to test the counter service by creating the following HTTP requests in a collection in Postman:

```
GET localhost:8080/counters
PUT localhost:8080/counters
```

and execute them.

You should use the following JSON representation of a counter resource in the body of the HTTP PUT request:

```
{
    "red": 3,
    "green": 2
}
```

### Experiment 2: REST API for TODO-items

Consider the Todo-class from software technology assignment 1: https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaPersistenceAPI/article.html#installation

Use the Spark/Java framework to implement a REST API for Todo-items that enables CRUD operations and uses JSON for the representation of todo-resources .

The REST API should make it possible to Create (POST) Todo-items, Read (GET) TODO-items, Update (PUT), and Delete (DELETE) Todo-items. See slide 36 from the lectures on web services for design principles on how you should organise the resources in a hierarchical information space of todo-items.

You may use the Spark/Java counter service project from experiment 1 as a starting point for the implementation.

### Experiment 3: Swagger (optional)

Try to investigate how Swagger may be used to specify the REST API from experiment 2.

### Experiment 4: XML representation (optional)

Investigate how the Spark/Java may be used to return and consume XML resource representations of the Todo-items.

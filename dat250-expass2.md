# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 2

## Task statement:
### 1: Introduction 
"The goal of this assignment is to make some initial experiment with the Java Persistence Architecture (JPA). This will include setting up a database for experimentation and study object-relational mapping."

### 2: Installation: Derby Database
Download and install the Apache Derby database by going through the tutorial which can be found here:
http://db.apache.org/derby/papers/DerbyTut/index.html

### Experiment 1: Application using JPA
Setup a Java application which uses JPA for storing entities in a database based on the following tutorial:
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaPersistenceAPI/article.html#installation

Find a way to inspect the database tables being created - either from the IDE or by logging into the database server.

### Experiment 2: Banking/Credit Card example JPA
Try to implement the domain model for credit cards corresponding to the small assignment that was introduced in the last lecture video on object-relationship mapping. Does the tables created correspond to your initial answer to the exercise.

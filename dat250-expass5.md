# Hand-in report
### Technical problems
I encountered two technical problems, during this assignment:
- Using Windows Powershell and cmd for running the application was problematic. Powershell did not recognize the term mvnw, and I could not find a way to fix this issue. Using cmd instead, worked like a charm during the first tutorial, but could not find out what to run when two (and more) tutorials shared the same repository. This may have an easy fix, but I did not want to wast any more time on it. The fix for me, was using the run-function in IntelliJ, so that I could easily choose what file to run at any time.
- The second tutorial seems to be missing the code for the application itself. I could, however, find it in their github-repo.
